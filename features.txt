autocorrect other people's comments and post titles
	for each comment or post title, run it through an autocorrect function.
	instead of showing the original comment or post title, show the resulting string autocorrect generates.
	a button is displayed next to the string toggles showing the original comment or post title when clicked.

delete all subreddit only comments
	if a comment matches regex "^r/.*$", don't show that comment or its children.
	possibly show it in a seperate panel instead. the panel could be a popout on the post or comment the subreddit tag was in response to.
